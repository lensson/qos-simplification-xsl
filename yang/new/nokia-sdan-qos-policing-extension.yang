           A policer uses parameters in pairs: the information rate
           determines the bandwidth, and a burstiness provides some
           timing elasticity to be applied on the first. E.g. a PIR
           (peak information rate) is combined with PBS (peak
           burst size).

           The threshold is a percentage to calculate a different
           burstiness parameter to be applied when policing a frame
           of the specified policing traffic class.

           The higher the threshold, the lower the chance the frame
           gets marked 'red' by the policer.
           The traffic which is configured with higher threshold
           would consume higher token bucket size and have a higher
           chance to have tokens.

           Example:  policing-tc  threshold
                               5         90%
                               2         40%
                               4         20%
           Suppose at moment 't' a frame has to be evaluated by the
           policer. When the frame is marked with policing-tc '5' the
           policer will evaluate whether this frame, (in combination
           with all earlier frames currently processing in the token
           bucket irrespective of the policing-tc they got assigned),
           will fit in the to be evaluated information rate combined
           with 90% of the configured burstiness. The same approach
           applies to the other policing traffic classes..";
